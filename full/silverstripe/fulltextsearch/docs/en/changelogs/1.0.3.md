# 1.0.3

## Upgrading

Users upgrading from 1.0.2 or below will need to run the Solr_Reindex task to refresh
each SolrIndex. This is due to a change in record IDs, which are now generated from
the base class of each DataObject, rather than the instance class, as well as fixes
to integration with the subsites module.

Developers working locally should be aware that by default, all indexes will be updated
in realtime when the environment is in dev mode, rather than attempting to queue these
updates with the queued jobs module (if installed).

## Bugfixes

 * BUG Fix old indexing storing against the incorrect class key
 * [Don't rely on MySQL ordering of index->getAdded()](https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-fulltextsearch/commit/4b51393e014fc4c0cc8e192c74eb4594acaca605)
