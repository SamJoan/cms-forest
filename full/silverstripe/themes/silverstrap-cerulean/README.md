silverstrap-cerulean
====================

An extension to [Silverstrap](http://dev.entidi.com/p/silverstrap/) that
uses the [Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/) theme instead of
the plain [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) theme.

The silverstrap-cerulean 2.x.x branch is based on silverstrap-2 that in
turn is based on Bootstrap 3. The still maintained master-1.0 branch is
based on silverstrap-1 that in turn is based on Bootstrap 2.
