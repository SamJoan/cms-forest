[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms)

## Introduction

UserForms enables CMS users to create dynamic forms via a drag and drop interface 
and without getting involved in any PHP code.

## Maintainer Contact

 * Will Rossiter (Nickname: wrossiter, willr) `<will (at) fullscreen (dot) io>`

## Requirements

 * SilverStripe 3.1

## Features

*  Construct a form using all major form fields (text, email, dropdown, radio, checkbox..)
*  Ability to extend userforms from other modules to provide extra fields.
*  Ability to email multiple people the form submission
*  View submitted submissions and export them to CSV
*  Define custom error messages and validation settings
*  Optionally display and hide fields using javascript based on users input
*  Pre fill your form fields, by passing your values by url (http://yoursite.com/formpage?EditableField1=MyValue)

## Installation

Installation can be done either by composer or by manually downloading a release.

### Via composer

`composer require "silverstripe/userforms:*"`

### Manually

 1.  Download the module from [the releases page](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms/releases).
 2.  Extract the file (if you are on windows try 7-zip for extracting tar.gz files
 3.  Make sure the folder after being extracted is named 'userforms' 
 4.  Place this directory in your sites root directory. This is the one with framework and cms in it.

### Configuration

After installation, make sure you rebuild your database through `dev/build`.

You should see a new PageType in the CMS 'User Defined Form'. This has a new 'Form' tab which has your form builder.

Translations of the natural language strings are managed through a third party translation interface, transifex.com. Newly added strings will be periodically uploaded there for translation, and any new translations will be merged back to the project source code.
